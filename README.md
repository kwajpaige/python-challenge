# python-challenge
Project Background
Complete the two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
The project contains two main forlder: PYBANK and PYPOLL
Each folder contains 
  A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used. 
  An "analysis" folder that contains a text file that has the results from the analysis.
  
Objectives:
PYBANK Challenge: Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company
PyPoll Challenge: Help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

PYBANK CHALLENGE
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
